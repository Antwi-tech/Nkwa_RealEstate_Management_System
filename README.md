#  Nkwa Real Estate Expenditure Management System

An offline-first, command-line Java application designed by Nkwa Real Estate Ltd to efficiently 
**track expenditures**, **manage bank accounts**, **categorize costs**, **handle receipts/invoices**, 
and generate **financial reports**, all using **vanilla Java** and **custom-built data structures** 
without external libraries.

---

##  Main Features

* **Expenditure Management**
  Record and view expenditures by code, amount, date, phase, category, and associated bank account.

* **Bank Account Management**
  Maintain multiple bank accounts with balance tracking and allow bank-based operations.

* **Category Management**
  Dynamically manage spending categories with enforcement of uniqueness.

* **Receipt Handling**
  Upload and review receipt/invoice documents, simulating an accounting approval workflow.

* **Search & Sort**
  Filter expenditures by date, category, account, or other properties; sort with custom algorithms.

 **Financial Reports & Analytics**
  Calculate monthly burn rates, profitability forecasts, and category-level cost impact.

* **Custom Data Structures**
  Includes home-grown implementations of HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, ArrayList, Stack, PriorityQueue (Min-Heap), TreeMap, and more.

* **File-Based Persistence**
  All data is stored in local text files (`expenditures.txt`, `accounts.txt`, `category.txt`, `receipts.txt`) for offline use.

##  How Data Structures Are Used

| Feature                 | Data Structure                                                | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expenditure storage** | `HashMap<String, Expenditure>`                                | Constant-time insert/lookup by code                     |
| **History listing**     | `LinkedList<String>`                                          | Preserves insertion order of expenditures               |
| **Category set**        | `HashSet<String>`                                             | Ensures unique categories and fast containment checks   |
| **Receipt queue**       | `Stack<Receipt>`                                              | LIFO order to review uploaded receipts                  |
| **Bank balances**       | `HashMap<String, BankAccount>` & `PriorityQueue<BankAccount>` | Fast account lookup and alerting for low balances       |
| **Sorting by category** | `ArrayList<String>` + Bubble sort                             | Simplicity for small/excluded datasets                  |
| **Monthly reports**     | `TreeMap<YearMonth, Double>`                                  | Automatically sorted by month for burn-rate aggregation |

### Algorithm Highlights

* **Sorting (Bubble Sort)**

    * Used for user-facing sorting tasks.
    * **Complexity**: O(n²) in worst-case; acceptable for few hundred entries.

* **Searching**

    * `HashMap.get()` for code/account lookups — O(1) average.
    * Category & account filters scan lists — O(n).

* **Aggregation**

    * `TreeMap` is implemented via a BST that aggregates by month in O(log n) per insertion on average,
    * and O(n) for in-order traversal.

##  Complexity Analysis

* **HashMap insert/get**:

    * *Time*: O(1) average, O(n) worst-case
    * *Space*: O(n)

* **HashSet add/contains**:

    * *Time*: O(1) average, O(n) worst-case
    * *Space*: O(n)

* **LinkedList addLast**:

    * *Time*: O(n) (could be improved with tail pointer)
    * *Space*: O(n)

* **ArrayList + Bubble Sort**:

    * *Time*: O(n²) in all cases
    * *Space*: O(n)

* **Stack push/pop**:

    * *Time*: O(1)

* **PriorityQueue add/poll (Min‑Heap)**:

    * *Time*: O(log n) per operation

* **TreeMap insert/traverse**:

    * *Time*: O(log n) average for insert, O(n) for full in-order traversal

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repository.
2. **Compile** all `.java` files:

   ```bash
   javac -d out src/**/*.java
   ```
3. **Run** the main class:

   ```bash
   java -cp out Expenditure_Management_System
   ```
4. **Interact** via the menu-driven CLI. View/write data in the `Menu/` directory files.

##  DSA Performance Benchmark

The system includes an in-built **performance testing module** (`DSAPerformanceTest`) that benchmarks 
the custom data structures used throughout the application.

###  What This Tells Us

These benchmarks measure **how quickly your custom-built data structures** handle large-scale data operations (10,000 items), giving insight into **time complexity**, **implementation efficiency**, and **real-world performance** in the application’s core functionality.

####  Interpretation

| Structure                   | Efficiency Verdict           | Reason                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ArrayList**               | **Inefficient for large sorting** | O(n²) bubble sort is slow for larger datasets; suitable only for small menus or short reports.    |
| **LinkedList Add**          |  Acceptable                  | O(n), but for 10k operations, 11ms is decent due to lightweight node management.                  |
| **HashMap Get/Put**         |  Reasonable                  | Slightly slower than expected (\~40ms), possibly due to primitive hashing or collision handling.  |
| **HashSet Add**             |  Could Be Improved           | Add performance close to HashMap; may be suffering from hash collision resolution inefficiencies. |
| **Stack Push/Pop**          |  Excellent                   | Constant-time operations showing sub-millisecond results.                                         |
| **PriorityQueue (Min-Heap)** | Very Efficient               | Add and poll remain within logarithmic bounds (\~4-9ms).                                          |
| **TreeMap (by Month)**      | **Very Efficient**         | Only 7ms for 10k monthly entries with update logic — great for reporting & trend analytics.       |

###  Summary

The application performs reliably with custom-built DSA logic and holds up under realistic data loads. 
Here’s how the performance maps to real functionality:

* **Menu Sorting/Filtering** → Uses `arrayList` and `bubbleSort`: fine for small menus but not for big logs.
* **Expenditure History** → `linkedList` for efficient sequential insertions.
* **Accounts & Expenditure Lookup** → `hashmap` for fast lookups of account codes and transactions.
* **Unique Categories** → `hashset` to prevent duplicates efficiently.
* **Receipts (LIFO)** → `stack` used to review uploads in reverse order.
* **Low Balance Alerts** → `priorityqueue` used to prioritize accounts with lowest balances.
* **Burn Rate/Monthly Reports** → `treeMap` organizes and aggregates costs per `YearMonth`.
